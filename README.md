# Staff-Promotion-Prediction
This is a use case where I attempt to use machine learning to study the pattern of promotion. 
With this insight, we can understand the important features among available features that can be used to predict promotion eligibility.
I can subsequently predict the staff that will be promoted from a new dataset.

I have written this in a python notebook, so the necessary comments are in the notebook.

Next steps:
While I used different machine learning algortihms independently, I believe that an ensemble approach may increase the accuracy of this model.
